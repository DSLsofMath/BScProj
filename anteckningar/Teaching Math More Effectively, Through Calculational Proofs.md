# Teaching Math more effectively, through calculational proofs

---

The following text is mostly my retelling of the parts I found were important but also partly my interpretation of the article *Teaching Math more effectively, through calculational proofs* by David Gries and Fred B. Schneider.

## Background
Early college math-courses try to avoid "formal mathematics" but in later courses you are shown how to formalize some expressions but that it is rarely worth the hassle. Students get little to no experience of designing proofs which leads to a kind of fear of math and mathematical notation. 

## Making a good proof
A mathematical proof should be easy to understand and, of course, be correct. A well made proof will clearly indicate facts and how they are combined. The proof should also be written so that it is very obvious for the reader how it all comes together and the reader should be able to explain it to others and perhaps make similar proofs themselves.

## How to teach?
Their thesis is that mathematics and the mathematical way of thinking can be taught by first teaching how to make formal, rigorous proofs. But it is all dependent of the choice of logic and how you write your proofs.

## How they chose their logic.
They chose Equational Logic, a logic which has a style which is reminiscent of what you encounter while taking highschool algebra courses, so a style which won't be totally foreign to the students that are targeted by this article.
Equational Logic rarely resembles an informal mathematical argument in plain English but instead relies on you solving and simplifying , by using the rules of the logic similarly to how you solve problems in highschool algebra. 
It was also chosen because it makes the proofs simpler to understand and can be used in a lot of different mathematical domains.
